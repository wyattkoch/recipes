    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>15 oz can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>5 large garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp oregano</li>
        <li>Paremsan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill large Dutch oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and spaghetti</li>
        <li>Separate pasta with tongs a few times during first 2 minutes of cooking. This will ensure spaghetti do not stick together</li>
        <li>Cook pasta uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al dente, stirring occasionally. Taste for doneness while cooking. Do not overcook until too soft. The key to tasty pasta is firm cooked pasta. Drain spaghetti in a colander</li>
        <li>Return pot to medium heat and add olive oil, 4 garlic cloves and oregano. Turn off the heat. Stir constantly for 20 seconds</li>
        <li>Add drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, black pepper and 1 garlic clove. Stir gently until warmed through</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately. This is the best cheap and quite healthy spaghetti I have ever had anywhere!</li>
    </ol>
